Direction

    Use one IDE that supports Github
        https://vscode.dev (Links to an external site.) 
        VS code, Code Block, and so on.
        Browser version of VS code
    Make the “Final” folder
    Periodic Commit 
        After major changes
        Every 10 minutes
        When you fix Errors (how to fix)
    The purpose of the commit
        to see how you make the program. 
        If there is no change history, you may not get full scores.

Code Explanation:

    It does not mean the comments
    The comments on the source will not be accepted as an explanation and description
    Describe the outline of your algorithm based on your assembly code
        explain the details of how it works(like a software development document)
        show the purpose of each register at the pseudo-code level 
        draw the memory layout if it is required
        show(draw) the bit representation if you use a certain part of the register
        explain all about your code 
        show the test results with the MULTIPLE test data set.
